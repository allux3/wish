                We make wishes in certain moments in our life, every day, once a year - it doesn't really matter.<br>

                <section id="4">Does that necessarily mean we aren't happy with who we are and what we have today? Maybe yes or maybe no. Maybe we will always wish for things no matter how great, successful, healthy and loved we are.

                <section id="6">So no matter where you are going, the deli, the bookstore or a party it's also completly alright to embrace this very moment. Wherever you are. Now. To just check in with your wishes, have they changed? what can you do to make them come true? </section>

                And then just let go of all the pressure weight they have on your shoulders. Welcome the unknown in your every day life because that's the only definitive answer you've got right now. </section>
